"""The CI workflow must actually run — and block on — the quality gates.

Two failure modes this guards against.

The first is silent weakening. A `continue-on-error: true` or a trailing
`|| true` turns a gate into decoration: the job stays green while Ruff, mypy,
or the test suite fails. That is invisible in review unless something asserts
it, because the step still appears in the log with its normal name.

The second is environment drift. CI builds its environment with
`uv sync --frozen` and then puts `.venv/bin` on `PATH` so later steps invoke
tools directly. A step that both syncs *and* runs a tool in the same `run:`
block cannot rely on `$GITHUB_PATH` — that only affects *subsequent* steps — so
it must export `PATH` itself. Getting this wrong produces a "command not found"
that only appears on the runner. It happened once while writing this file.

These tests read the workflow as data. They deliberately assert on the
*presence and blocking-ness* of invocations, not on exact formatting, so
ordinary edits to flags or arguments do not fail them.
