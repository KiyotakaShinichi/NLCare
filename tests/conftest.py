"""Pytest bootstrap and the default test-environment contract.

Two responsibilities:

1. Put the repository root on ``sys.path``. Some Windows environments invoke
   ``pytest`` through a console script that does not, and the release gate
   documents ``pytest tests/test_breast_monitoring.py -q`` as the smoke
   command, so that exact entrypoint has to stay reliable.

2. Enforce that the default suite is **hermetic**: no outbound network, no
   third-party credentials. A fresh clone with no `.env`, no API keys, and no
   running Ollama/n8n/MLflow must produce the same results as a developer
   machine that happens to have all of them.

Why the egress guard exists
---------------------------
The backend contains real adapters for Groq, Ollama, Pinecone, Azure Search,
n8n, cBioPortal, and MLflow. Each is *supposed* to be gated behind
configuration, but "supposed to be" is not a contract — a single call site
that forgets its guard turns the suite into something that passes only where
those services answer, and fails or hangs everywhere else. Blocking egress
converts that from a silent environmental dependency into an immediate,
attributable test failure.

This blocks **transport**, never behaviour. No safety policy, DEP-001
classifier, evaluator, or medical logic is stubbed here: those are exercised
for real. A test that genuinely needs the network marks itself `requires_network` and
is deselected from the default run by `pytest.ini`.
