# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder captures the decisions that **actually moved the
architecture** — the ones a future contributor needs to understand
before changing the surrounding code, and the ones that would be
expensive to reverse silently.

Format: each ADR is one short markdown file. Status is one of
`accepted`, `superseded`, or `deprecated`. New ADRs use the next
sequential number — never reuse a number even after deprecation.

## When to write a new ADR

- A decision is **structural** (it affects how multiple modules talk).
- A decision is **load-bearing** (other decisions assume it).
- A decision **trades one risk for another** (not just "we picked X
  for convenience").
- A decision **enforces a boundary** that future contributors might
  weaken without realising.

Skip ADRs for: refactors that don't change interfaces, dependency
bumps, formatting, comment edits.
